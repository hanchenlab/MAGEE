\title{
GLMM based single variant tests for gene-environment interactions
}
\description{
Use a glmmkin class object from the null GLMM to perform single variant main effect score test, gene-environment interaction test, or joint test for association with genotypes in a GDS file .gds.
}
\usage{
glmm.gei(null.obj, interaction, geno.file, outfile, bgen.samplefile = NULL, 
  interaction.covariates = NULL,  meta.output = F, center=T, MAF.range = c(1e-7, 0.5), 
  miss.cutoff = 1, missing.method = "impute2mean", nperbatch=100, ncores = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{null.obj}{
a class glmmkin object, returned by fitting the null GLMM using \code{glmmkin( )}.
}
  \item{interaction}{
a numeric or a character vector indicating the environmental factors. If a numeric vector, it represents which indices in the order of covariates are the environmental factors; if a character vector, it represents the variable names of the environmental factors.
}
  \item{geno.file}{
the full name of a GDS file (including the suffix .gds).
}
  \item{outfile}{
the output file name.
}
  \item{bgen.samplefile}{
path to the BGEN .sample file. Required when the BGEN file does not contain sample identifiers.
}
  \item{interaction.covariates}{
a numeric or a character vector indicating the interaction covariates. If a numeric vector, it represents which indices in the order of covariates are the interaction covariates; if a character vector, it represents the variable names of the interaction covariates.
}
\item{meta.output}{
boolean value to modiy the output file.If TRUE, the GxE effect estimate and variance and covariance associated with the effect estimate are included in the output file. (default = FALSE)
}
  \item{center}{
a logical switch for centering genotypes before tests. If TRUE, genotypes will be centered to have mean 0 before tests, otherwise raw values will be directly used in tests (default = TRUE).
}
  \item{MAF.range}{
a numeric vector of length 2 defining the minimum and maximum minor allele frequencies of variants that should be included in the analysis (default = c(1e-7, 0.5)).
}
  \item{miss.cutoff}{
the maximum missing rate allowed for a variant to be included (default = 1, including all variants).
}
  \item{missing.method}{
method of handling missing genotypes.Either "impute2mean" or "omit" (default = "impute2mean").
}
  \item{nperbatch}{
an integer for how many SNPs should be tested in a batch (default = 100). The computational time can increase dramatically if this value is either small or large. The optimal value for best performance depends on the user's system.
}
  \item{ncores}{
a positive integer indicating the number of cores to be used in parallel computing (default = 1).
}
